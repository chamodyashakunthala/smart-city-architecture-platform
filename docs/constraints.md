# Constraints – Disaster Management System
      What limits or realities must we accept cause we wouldn't be able to work in the perfect world.
## C1: Unstable Network Connectivity
During disasters, internet and mobile networks may be unreliable or partially
unavailable.

## C2: Limited Infrastructure
Some affected areas may lack access to modern devices or stable power supply.

## C3: Budget and Resource Limitations
The system must be cost-effective and avoid unnecessary infrastructure
overhead during non-disaster periods.

## C4: Legal and Regulatory Constraints
The system must comply with data protection and privacy regulations when
handling personal and location-based data.

## C5: Multi-Organization Coordination
The system must support collaboration among different government agencies,
NGOs, and private organizations with varying technical capabilities.
