 Disaster Management System – Problem Statement

Natural disasters such as floods , and landslides in SriLanka cause massive
damage to life and infrastructure. During such events, emergency response
teams face challenges such as lack of real-time information, system overload,
communication failures, and poor coordination among multiple stakeholders.

Existing systems often fail under peak load or depend heavily on stable
network connectivity, which is unreliable during disasters.

The goal of this project is to design a scalable, fault-tolerant, and
resilient disaster management system architecture that enables efficient
coordination between citizens, rescue teams, hospitals, and authorities,
even under extreme conditions.
